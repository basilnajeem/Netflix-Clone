## Netflix Clone (Sample Version)

Welcome to my sample version of the Netflix clone! This project was created as a simple test version to help me learn HTML and CSS coding. 
Please note that this version may not include all the features of the original Netflix platform.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### Usage

To view the Netflix clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone` followed by http or ssh link.
2. Alternatively, you can download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Please keep in mind that this is a basic version created for learning purposes and may not provide the full functionality of a complete Netflix clone. 
It serves as a starting point for understanding HTML and CSS and Bootstrap concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications to enhance your learning experience. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding ðŸ˜Š
